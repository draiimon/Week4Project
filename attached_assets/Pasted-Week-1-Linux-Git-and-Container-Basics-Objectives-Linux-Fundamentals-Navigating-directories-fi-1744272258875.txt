Week 1: Linux, Git, and Container Basics
Objectives
Linux Fundamentals
Navigating directories, file permissions, environment variables, process management.
Shell scripting basics (writing a simple .sh script).
Git & Version Control
Git workflow (clone, branch, commit, push, pull, merge).
Working with GitHub or GitLab for repository hosting.
Introduction to Containers
Docker basics: images vs. containers, Dockerfiles, Docker commands.
Building and running a simple Docker container locally.
Hands-On Tasks / Short Project
Set Up a Linux Environment
Use a local VM (VirtualBox, VMware) or a cloud VM (AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine) running a Linux distro (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.).
Git Practice
Initialize a sample Git repository, create branches, merge changes.
Push the repo to GitHub or GitLab.
Containerizing a Simple App
Write a basic Dockerfile for a “Hello World” or small web application (e.g., a Node.js or Python Flask app).
Build, run, and confirm the container is functioning locally.
Outcome
 Interns will be comfortable with basic Linux commands, Git workflows, and Docker fundamentals—enabling them to collaborate on projects and containerize simple services.

Week 2: CI/CD Pipelines
Objectives
Continuous Integration (CI)
Understand the benefits of CI: automated builds, testing, and code quality checks.
Explore a CI platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins).
Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)
Automatic deployment triggers after successful CI builds/tests.
Common strategies for deployments (blue-green, rolling, canary).
Integrating Docker with CI
Building Docker images in a pipeline.
Storing images in a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).
Hands-On Tasks / Short Project
Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline
Choose a small application (could be the app containerized in Week 1).
Configure a simple pipeline to:
Check out code from Git.
Build and test the application (unit tests, lint checks, etc.).
Build a Docker image upon successful tests.
(Optional) Push the image to a registry.
Automated Testing
Incorporate at least one basic test (e.g., unit test, integration test) so interns see how a failing test stops the pipeline.
Outcome
 Interns will understand how to automate builds, tests, and container image creation via a CI/CD tool—paving the way for fully automated deployments in the cloud.

Week 3: Cloud Services & Infrastructure as Code
Objectives
Cloud Provider Basics
Choose a cloud: AWS or GCP (or Azure).
Learn core services: compute (EC2/Compute Engine), storage (S3/Cloud Storage), networking (VPC, security groups/firewalls).
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Introduction to Terraform or AWS CloudFormation / Azure Resource Manager / Google Cloud Deployment Manager.
Defining infrastructure in code: creating VMs, networks, and other resources.
Deploying Containerized Apps to the Cloud
Running containers on AWS ECS/Fargate, EKS (Kubernetes), or GCP’s Cloud Run / GKE.
Managing environment variables/secrets.
Hands-On Tasks / Short Project
Cloud Setup
Create a free tier account (AWS/GCP/Azure) if possible.
Spin up a small VM or container service (e.g., AWS ECS, GCP Cloud Run).
Terraform / IaC Project
Write a simple Terraform file (or equivalent) to provision a VM and a network in the chosen cloud.
Deploy your containerized app (from Weeks 1–2) to that VM or a managed container service.
Networking & Security Basics
Set up security groups, firewall rules, or inbound/outbound policies for the container/VM.
Validate that the app is reachable from a public URL or private IP (depending on design).
Outcome
 Interns gain hands-on cloud experience, understand how to manage infrastructure with code, and deploy containerized applications in a cloud environment.

Week 4: Final Exam – End-to-End DevOps Project
Objective
Consolidate all skills from the first three weeks into a single, cohesive project:
Containerizing an application.
Setting up a CI pipeline to build and test containers.
Provisioning infrastructure in the cloud with IaC.
Deploying the container(s) to the cloud environment.
Project Description: “Cloud Deployed Web Service”
Scenario: A small web application (e.g., a simple REST API or a front-end service) that needs an automated DevOps pipeline and cloud deployment.
Requirements
Code & Container


Store the application code in Git.
Write a Dockerfile for containerization.
The application can be a simple Node.js, Python, or any language that interns are comfortable with.
CI Pipeline


Upon code pushes, automatically run tests.
If tests pass, build a Docker image and push it to a registry.
(For the final exam, the emphasis is on building the pipeline, though actual production deployment triggers can be optional or manual if time is short.)
Infrastructure as Code


Provision your environment using Terraform (or an equivalent IaC tool).
Create necessary resources:
Compute instance, or container service (ECS, Cloud Run, etc.).
Networking/firewalls.
(Optional) Use variables or modules for reusability and best practices.
Deployment


Deploy the container to the cloud environment.
Confirm the service is accessible (public endpoint or private if that’s the scenario).
Document your deployment steps or embed them in the pipeline if feasible.
Documentation & Presentation


A README that describes how to run the pipeline, deploy the infrastructure, and access the app.
A short presentation/demonstration showing the pipeline logs and the running app in the cloud.
Assessment Criteria
Completeness: Did the intern containerize the app, automate the build/test, and provision cloud resources with IaC?
Code Quality & Organization: Dockerfile clarity, Terraform/IaC structure, pipeline readability.
Deployment Success: Is the application actually reachable in the cloud?
Documentation: Clear instructions on reproducing the setup.
Outcome
 By the end of Week 4, interns will have a portfolio-ready project demonstrating the entire DevOps lifecycle: local containerization, automated CI, IaC-driven infrastructure, and a cloud-based deployment.

Additional Tips & Recommendations
Mentorship & Guidance


Assign a mentor or senior engineer to review code, Dockerfiles, Terraform scripts, and pipelines each week.
Encourage interns to ask questions openly.
Pair Programming / Peer Collaboration


Have interns team up on tasks or code reviews. This fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing.
Version Control Best Practices


Mandate pull requests (PRs) with code reviews.
Teach interns to keep commits small and descriptive.
Security & Cost Awareness


Remind interns to use free tiers or test accounts on cloud providers to avoid large bills.
Encourage them to tear down resources when not in use.
Documentation & Presentations


Have interns maintain a simple wiki or README for each phase.
At the end of each week, let them demonstrate their short project or show pipeline logs.
