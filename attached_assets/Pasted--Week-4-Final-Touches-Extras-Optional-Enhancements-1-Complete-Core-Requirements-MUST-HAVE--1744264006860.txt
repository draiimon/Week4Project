✅ Week 4 – Final Touches, Extras & Optional Enhancements
✅ 1. Complete Core Requirements (MUST-HAVE)
You’re good if you’ve completed:

 Dockerfile for your app

 Working CI/CD pipeline

 Cloud infra provisioned with Terraform (EC2 or ECS)

 Deployed container accessible via IP or domain

 Proper documentation in README.md

💅 2. UI Enhancements (Project Looks Matter!)
Since you mentioned it:

 Implement an orange and gray color scheme on your front-end UI.

 Use a lightweight CSS framework (Tailwind, Bootstrap, or even plain CSS) for fast styling.

 Mobile responsiveness (optional but a bonus).

 Add meaningful content (like a heading, footer, maybe a form).

🔒 3. Signup/Auth with AWS (If Time Allows)
Optional if time is short, but if you're comfortable, this is a power move.

 Use AWS Cognito or a custom signup logic with AWS RDS/DynamoDB for user registration.

 Store user info in DynamoDB or a simple PostgreSQL DB on RDS.

 If you go with RDS:

Terraform should provision RDS too.

Make sure DB security group allows access from your app.

 Encrypt passwords (use bcrypt or similar).

 Handle basic JWT-based login (bonus points!).

📦 4. Folder Structure Cleanup
Make your repo clean and professional:

bash
Copy
Edit
/app
  └── server.js (or app.py, etc.)
  └── Dockerfile
/terraform
  └── main.tf
.github/workflows
  └── ci.yml
README.md
.gitignore
📚 5. Documentation Checklist
Your README.md should cover:

 Project overview (1-2 lines)

 How to run locally (Docker command or npm start)

 CI/CD workflow description

 AWS setup (mention Terraform)

 How to deploy using Terraform

 Link or IP to live app

 Screenshots (optional but really nice!)

🎥 6. Demo / Presentation (Final Deliverable)
You don’t need a fancy slideshow—just show your work clearly.

Record or present:

 GitHub repo walkthrough

 GitHub Actions logs running successfully

 Terraform apply and resulting infrastructure

 Live app running (with your custom UI)

 Brief mention of what you learned each week

🧼 7. Clean-Up Tips (Post-Project)
 Destroy cloud resources when not in use: terraform destroy

 Rotate AWS access keys if exposed

 Keep repo public/private depending on portfolio plans

🏁 Bonus: Add These If You Want Extra Credit
CI/CD Deploys to ECS automatically (in the pipeline).

Use Route53 and a custom domain for your app.

Use SSL (via AWS ACM or certbot).

Add a health check endpoint or status page.
