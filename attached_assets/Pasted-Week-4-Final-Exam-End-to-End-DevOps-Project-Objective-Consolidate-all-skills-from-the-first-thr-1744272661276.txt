Week 4: Final Exam – End-to-End DevOps Project
Objective
Consolidate all skills from the first three weeks into a single, cohesive project:
Containerizing an application.
Setting up a CI pipeline to build and test containers.
Provisioning infrastructure in the cloud with IaC.
Deploying the container(s) to the cloud environment.
Project Description: “Cloud Deployed Web Service”
Scenario: A small web application (e.g., a simple REST API or a front-end service) that needs an automated DevOps pipeline and cloud deployment.
Requirements
Code & Container


Store the application code in Git.
Write a Dockerfile for containerization.
The application can be a simple Node.js, Python, or any language that interns are comfortable with.
CI Pipeline


Upon code pushes, automatically run tests.
If tests pass, build a Docker image and push it to a registry.
(For the final exam, the emphasis is on building the pipeline, though actual production deployment triggers can be optional or manual if time is short.)
Infrastructure as Code


Provision your environment using Terraform (or an equivalent IaC tool).
Create necessary resources:
Compute instance, or container service (ECS, Cloud Run, etc.).
Networking/firewalls.
(Optional) Use variables or modules for reusability and best practices.
Deployment


Deploy the container to the cloud environment.
Confirm the service is accessible (public endpoint or private if that’s the scenario).
Document your deployment steps or embed them in the pipeline if feasible.
Documentation & Presentation


A README that describes how to run the pipeline, deploy the infrastructure, and access the app.
A short presentation/demonstration showing the pipeline logs and the running app in the cloud.
Assessment Criteria
Completeness: Did the intern containerize the app, automate the build/test, and provision cloud resources with IaC?
Code Quality & Organization: Dockerfile clarity, Terraform/IaC structure, pipeline readability.
Deployment Success: Is the application actually reachable in the cloud?
Documentation: Clear instructions on reproducing the setup.
Outcome
 By the end of Week 4, interns will have a portfolio-ready project demonstrating the entire DevOps lifecycle: local containerization, automated CI, IaC-driven infrastructure, and a cloud-based deployment.

Additional Tips & Recommendations
Mentorship & Guidance


Assign a mentor or senior engineer to review code, Dockerfiles, Terraform scripts, and pipelines each week.
Encourage interns to ask questions openly.
Pair Programming / Peer Collaboration


Have interns team up on tasks or code reviews. This fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing.
Version Control Best Practices


Mandate pull requests (PRs) with code reviews.
Teach interns to keep commits small and descriptive.
Security & Cost Awareness


Remind interns to use free tiers or test accounts on cloud providers to avoid large bills.
Encourage them to tear down resources when not in use.
Documentation & Presentations


Have interns maintain a simple wiki or README for each phase.
At the end of each week, let them demonstrate their short project or show pipeline logs.

Program Summary
Week 1:


Linux basics, Git fundamentals, and Docker intro.
Short Project: Containerize a “Hello World” app.
Week 2:


CI/CD fundamentals, setting up a basic pipeline to build & test.
Short Project: Automate Docker image building and push to a registry upon successful tests.
Week 3:


Cloud services (AWS/GCP/Azure) + Infrastructure as Code (Terraform or equivalent).
Short Project: Provision a VM or container service and deploy your containerized app.
Week 4:


Final Exam: Integrate all steps into an end-to-end DevOps workflow.
Deliver a fully automated pipeline, IaC provisioning, and a live cloud deployment of your containerized application.
